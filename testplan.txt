The program takes in 3 arguments:
        index <inverted-index file name> <directory or file name>
Any different number of arguments will print out a message and exit.
The code checks if the given arguments 
<inverted-index file name> already exists and if <directory or file name> is not a regular directory or file.
Does not do the following.
* index a file that doesn�t exist or isn�t a regular file
* write to a file that already exists
* crash when the file to be written in and the file to be indexed are the same

As I tested the code, I tried it on a variety of different file formats to make sure only valid tokens (and no garbage) gets added to the index:
Example
Directory: funfiles/
                      Dump.txt
                      Dump2.txt
                      funfiles2/
                                 surprise.txt

Dump.txt contains the following text:
�Hello#$%my@name is $Thalia ^and* (I-+ love tAking$Naps.�

Dump2.txt contains the following text:
�Halloweeny@Halloweeny@Halloweeny@Halloweeny@Halloweeny�


surpise.txt contains the following text:
